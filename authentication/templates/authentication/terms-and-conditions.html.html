            the current terms and conditions of the site. <br> <br>
            b. There are three directory plans available: <br><br>
            <strong>Basic:</strong>No annual cost. Features include: adding your profile to one directory in one
            country. <br> <br>

            c. You can opt to upgrade or downgrade your service agreement to any other contract agreement that Virar
            is currently offering for sale at any time during your contract term. In the event of a contract downgrade,
            a discount credit will be issued to your Virar account for the difference in the cost of the two
            contracts over the remainder of your original contract term. This credit can be applied to future months of
            service with Virar, and is in no way transferable to a cash refund. <br><br>

            support. Any cancellation issued via your user panel must be completed at least one (1) working day prior to
            the end of the contract term. Any cancellation carried out via Virar customer support must be carried out
            at least three (3) working days prior to the end of the contract term to allow for adequate processing time.
            <br><br>
            e. Only Services and features clearly indicated as "free" are free or without charge. It is not the
            responsibility of Virar to provide free support to you in the use and operation of Virar. <br><br>
            f. If you purchase any Services that we offer for a Fee, you agree to both Virar and our third party
            service providers to store your payment information. You give express permission for us to charge you for
            (i) a monthly Fee for any applicable Services, billed on a monthly basis, (ii) any other Fees for Services
            you may purchase, and (iii) any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Services to the payment
            card you provide and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. If the
            card information you provide expires and you do not provide new card information, or cancel your bank
            account, you authorize us to continue billing you and you agree to remain responsible for any uncollected
            Fees. <br><br>

            judges. Only sites awarded "Site of the Day" will receive their scores, by means of their publication on our
            site. <br><br>
